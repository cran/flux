FLUX VERSIONS


Version 0.1-5

	* The functionality of flux() and fluxes() 
	is now in flux() including pretty printing
	to the console. fluxes() has been abandoned.
	
	* The range limits are now returned with the flux
	results
	
	* New export() function for simple export.
	
	* The behaviour of inspect() has been changed.
	The function now understands lazy naming: So only 
	the parts of the measurement names that are 
	necessary for unambiguous identification have to
	be given. Therefore, the sustain-argument has 
	been abandoned.
	
	* New plot.fluxes() function. Additionaly the 
	maximum range of xlim in a dataset is taken per 
	default for the xlims of the single figures to 
	ease comparison.
	
	* When prettily printing to the console the
	names of the gases are now printed for objects
	of class fluxes.
	
	* Also the leak.flag can be hardflagged now.
	
	* The gc quality flags can now be missing. In this
	case the function simply assumes that all 
	measurements were OK.
	
	* Function CO2.control() has been abandoned. 
	Because the new fluxes() handles co2ntrol in
	a different way than flux() did it is not necessary 
	anymore.
	
	

Version 0.1-4

	* Considerable changes to almost all functions
	including code clean-up and discontinuation
	of some arguments (e.g. rl.backup and in.unit 
	in flux, start in flux.odae).	
	
	* New function fluxes for estimating fluxes for
	all three major greenhouse gases at once.
	
	* New function inspect for simple inspection
	and alteration of concentration measurement tables.
	
	* New print functions for objects of classes fluss
	and fluxes to give comprehensive but easy to grasp
	output to the console
	
	* Update to flux: argument column has been changed 
	to var.par and allows better control (i.e.
	the input of variables and fixed parameters).
	This also allows to hand through data that 
	shall later be used in further analyses.
	
	* Further updates to flux: Option for p values 
	for the fitted models in the result, 
	
	* Air pressure still defaults to 101325 Pa in 
	the low level function gflux but must be also
	given in flux and related functions through 
	var.par as a fixed parameter or a variable
	
	* Output units are per default determined auto-
	matically to give pretty numbers (0.01 < x <= 10).
	The possibility 
	
	* Flags are global and appear in the same way in
	the table outputs and figures. Via the new 
	argument hardflag flags can be changed from soft
	to hard flag. Per default only the range flag is
	a hard flag (matches the former behaviour).
	
	* Update to CO2.control: max.nrmse can be specified
	separately.
	

Version 0.1-3
	
	* Bug fixes to flux.calib and flux
	* Added argument to function flux (co2ntrol).
	* New function CO2.control that controls how
	the evaluation of the CO2 data influences the 
	flux rate estimation for the other gases
	* New print.fluss function. The results of the
	flux() estimation are now displayed nicely as
	a table and the complex result is hidden.


Version 0.1-2
	
	* Several minor fixes to flux-package.Rd
	* Bugfix to plot.fluss.


Version 0.1-1
	
	* The first version. Could still be unstable.
