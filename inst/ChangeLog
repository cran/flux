FLUX VERSIONS


Version 0.1-4

	* Considerable changes to almost all functions.
	
	* Argument column has been changed to var.par
	in function flux and allows better control (i.e.
	the input of variables and fixed parameters).
	This also allows to hand through data that 
	shall later be used in further analyses.
	
	* Air pressure still defaults to 101325 Pa in 
	the low level function gflux but must be also
	given in flux and related functions through 
	var.par as a fixed parameter or a variable
	
	* Output units are per default determined auto-
	matically to give pretty numbers (0.01 < x <= 10).
	
	* Flags are global and appear in the same way in
	the table outputs and figures. Via the new 
	argument hardflag flags can be changed from soft
	to hard flag. Per default only the range flag is
	a hard flag (matches the former behaviour).
	
	

Version 0.1-3
	
	* Bug fixes to flux.calib and flux
	* Added argument to function flux (co2ntrol).
	* New function CO2.control that controls how
	the evaluation of the CO2 data influences the 
	flux rate estimation for the other gases
	* New print.fluss function. The results of the
	flux() estimation are now displayed nicely as
	a table and the complex result is hidden.

Version 0.1-2
	
	* Several minor fixes to flux-package.Rd
	* Bugfix to plot.fluss.

Version 0.1-1
	
	* The first version. Could still be unstable.
