\title{
Flux rate estimation with dynamic closed chamber data
}
\description{
Several functions for the estimation of greenhouse gas flux rates using dynamic closed chamber concentration measurements. The package follows a modular concept: Fluxes can be calculated in just two simple steps or in several steps if more control is wanted.

Obtain flux rates from many chamber measurements within minutes. After 
preparing the read in data (Field or device measured concentration data on 
the three most prominent greenhouse gases) with \code{\link{conz.prep}} just 
run \code{\link{flux}} or \code{\link{fluxes}} on the result returned by 
\code{\link{conz.prep}} and get flux rates in an easy to interpret table
including quality flags. Plot diagnostic plots as pdf per factor level 
to a folder or simply to the screen.
